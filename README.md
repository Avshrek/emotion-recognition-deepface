# emotion-recognition-deepface
Built a real-time facial emotion recognition system using DeepFace and OpenCV, performing local deep learning inference on live webcam input. Designed an end-to-end pipeline for face detection, emotion classification, and real-time visualization while accounting for latency and model loading constraints.
